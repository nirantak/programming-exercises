# Street Light Towers

## Program: [street_lights.py](https://github.com/nirantak/Programming_Exercises/blob/master/Misc/street_lights.py)

## Problem Description

There are N number of Light towers (L1...LN) with height (Hi). Amount of area lighted by a tower of height Hi is shown in the image.

Total Area for this case is Hi2. These towers are placed on a long road. You need to find the total amount of area has light.

## Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
0<= P <= 1000
1<= H <= 1000

## Input Format

The first line contains one Integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains one Integer N - the number of light towers. In next N lines, each line contains two integers P and H, where P represents the position and H represents the height.

## Output

T double values in T lines represent the area for each test case.
